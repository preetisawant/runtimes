# Install Liberty features
{: #install-features}

The Liberty for Java runtime includes [a subset of features](libertyFeatures.html#liberty_features) that are available in Liberty. You can install features that are not included in the runtime by running the Liberty `installUtility` command as a Cloud Foundry pre-runtime hook when the application is pushed to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

For a full list of available features, see [Liberty features ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_feat.html).

For information on using pre-runtime hooks, see [Configure Pre-Runtime Hooks ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html#profile) in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

1. In the root directory of the application that you want to push to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, create a `.profile.d` directory.

1. In the `.profile.d` directory, create a script file that runs the `installUtility` command as shown in the following example.

   This example installs the `javaee-8.0` feature.

   ```
   #!/bin/sh
   echo "Installing javaee-8.0"
   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/app/.java/jre/bin

   $HOME/.liberty/bin/installUtility install javaee-8.0 --acceptLicense
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   You can install multiple features by specifying additional features names separated by spaces.
   {: tip}

1. Push your app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, using the `-p` parameter to specify the application's root directory.

   For example, run the following command to push your app:
   ```
   ibmcloud cf push myApp -p /<path-to-application>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

1. Verify that the feature installed successfully by viewing the application's recent log.

   For example, run the following command to display the log:
   ```
   ibmcloud cf logs myApp --recent
   ```
   {: codeblock}

    If the feature was installed, the output shows the following messages:
