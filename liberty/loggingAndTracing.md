# Configure logging and tracing
{: #logging_tracing}

## Log files
{: #log_files}

The standard Liberty logs, such as `messages.log` or the `ffdc` directory, are available in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} in the `logs` directory of each application instance. These logs can be accessed from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console or via the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI. For example:

* To access recent logs for an app, run the following command:

  ```
  ibmcloud cf logs --recent <appname>
  ```
  {: codeblock}


* To see the `messages.log` file of an app, run the following command:

  ```
  ibmcloud cf ssh <appname> -c "cat logs/messages.log"
  ```
  {: codeblock}

The log level and other trace options can be set through the Liberty configuration file. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Liberty: Logging and Trace](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_logging.html).

## Using the trace and dump capabilities
{: #using_trace_and_dump}

### Using trace and dump in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console (Deprecated)

The Liberty tracing configuration can be adjusted for a running application directly from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. The console also provides capability for requesting and downloading thread and heap dumps. In order to adjust the tracing configuration or request a dump, select a Liberty application in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console and choose the `Runtime` menu in the navigation. In the `Runtime` view, select an instance and press the *TRACE* or *DUMP* button. If adjusting the trace level, see [Troubleshooting Liberty: Logging and Trace](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_logging.html) for the details of the syntax of the trace specification.

### Changing trace configuration via SSH

When you push the application, the server.xml file includes the default properties  **updateTrigger** set to **polled** and **monitorInterval** set to 1 minute. The Liberty server is automatically configured to check for updates to the server.xml each minute.

See [Push Liberty apps with server.xml](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/runtimes/liberty/optionsForPushing.html#options_for_pushing) for options to push Liberty apps with a customized sever.xml

See [Controlling Dynamic Updates](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_setup_dyn_upd.html){: new_window} for how to set up dynamic update in the server.xml.

Follow these steps to change tracing configuration:

1. SSH to your app

  ```
 ibmcloud cf ssh <appname> [-i instance_index]
  ```
  {: codeblock}

2. Edit ```<logging traceSpecification="xxxx"/>``` in the server.xml to set your desired trace specification,  for example using *vi*:

  ```
vi /app/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/server.xml
  ```
  {: codeblock}

Note: The server.xml change will be lost on a restage or restart and is only valid for the instance you ssh into.

See [Troubleshooting Liberty: Logging and Trace](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/rwlp_logging.html){: new_window} for the details of the syntax of the trace specification.

### Triggering dumps via SSH

Use the command below to trigger a thread and heap dump via {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI using the SSH feature:

  ```
 ibmcloud cf ssh <appname> -c "pkill -3 java"
  ```
  {: codeblock}

See the documentation below for details on downloading the generated dump files.

## Download dump files
{: #download_dumps}

By default, the various dump files are placed in the `dumps` directory of the application container. Use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI `ibmcloud cf ssh` to view and download the dump files.

* To see the generated dumps, run the following command:

  ```
  ibmcloud cf ssh <appname> -c "ls -l dumps"
  ```
  {: codeblock}

* To download a dump file, run the following command:

  ```
  ibmcloud cf ssh <appname> -i <instance_id> -c "cat dumps/<dump_file_name>" > <local_dump_file_name>
  ```
  {: codeblock}

It is also possible to use `scp` and other similar tools to view and download the dump files. Refer to [Accessing Apps with SSH  ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-apps.html) for more information.
